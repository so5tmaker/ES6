// Implement Binary Search
// Binary search is an O(log(n)) efficiency algorithm for searching a sorted array to find an element.
// It operates using the following steps:

// Find the middle value of a sorted array. If value == target return true (The value has been found and the search is complete).
// If middle value < target, search right half of array in next compare.
// If middle value > target, search left half of array in next compare.
// If after searching the whole array the value is not present, return false (The array has been searched and the value is not in the array).
// As you can see, you are successively halving an array, which gives you the log(n) efficiency.
// For this challenge, we want you to show your work - how you got to the target value... the path you took!
// Write a function binarySearch that implements the binary search algorithm on an array, 
// returning the path you took (each middle value comparison) to find the target in an array.

// The function takes a sorted array of integers and a target value as input. It returns an array containing (in-order) 
// the middle value you found at each halving of the original array until you found the target value.
// The target value should be the last element of the returned array. If the value is not found, return the string Value Not Found.

// For example, binarySearch([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 5) would return [4, 6, 5].

// For this challenge, when halving, you MUST use Math.floor() when doing division: Math.floor(x / 2).This will give a consistent, testable path.

//     Note: The following array will be used in tests:

const testArray = [
    0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
    23, 49, 70
];

function binarySearch(searchList, value) {
    let low = 0;
    let high = searchList.length - 1;
    let arrayPath = [];
    while (low <= high) {
        let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        const current = searchList[mid];
        if (value === current) {
            arrayPath.push(value);
            return arrayPath;
        }
        if (value > current) {
            low = ++mid;
        }
        if (value < current) {
            high = --mid;
        }
        arrayPath.push(current);
    }
    return 'Value Not Found';
}

console.log(binarySearch(testArray, 5));
console.log(binarySearch([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 5));
